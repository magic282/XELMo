# XELMo
A standalone [ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo) package.

In order to use ELMo, one may need to install a full allennlp package. This is just a slightly lightweight package to use ELMo.

It is not a reimplementation of ELMo. It just removed unnecessary code from the allennlp package (release [v0.5.1](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/releases/tag/v0.5.1)).

There is no warrant of correctness. Use at your own risk.
